# BlocklySummit2019-Fields

Contains the source for all of the fields used in the Blockly 2019 Summit Custom Fields presentation. You can see these fields in action at the following address: http://bekawestberg.me/projects/blockly-summit-2019-demo/

All source and images are free to use.

Be warned that while all of these fields demonstrate the proper use of the fields API (at least as it stood at the time of creation), not all of them are production ready. The field_flyout contains known bugs, and none of the fields have been tested for edge cases. If you intend to use these fields in a published product, they will most likely need some cleaning.
